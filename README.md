# Learning Apache Ignite Through Examples

This project introduces you to essential capabilities of Ignite by showing how to build an application that uses various
APIs of the project. In particular, you're going to use the World database schema to learn how to access and process 
data with SQL, compute, key-value APIs. In addition, you' will see how to update records of cities with Ignite 
transactions and subscribe for data changes that happen on server nodes. 

Based on your preferences you can head in one of two possible directions:

* Use the module with [the source code templates](https://github.com/GridGain-Demos/ignite-learning-by-examples/tree/master/template)
to finish implementing the application. That's a suggested learning approach.

* Or execute the [completed version of the application](https://github.com/GridGain-Demos/ignite-learning-by-examples/tree/master/complete)
and watch the [webinar this application was created for](https://www.gridgain.com/resources/webinars/learn-apache-ignite-through-coding-examples)
if anything is unclear.
