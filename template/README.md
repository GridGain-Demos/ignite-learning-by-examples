# Source Code Templates: Learning Apache Ignite Through Examples

Follow the steps below to start an Ignite cluster and experiment with various APIs and capabilities.

## Starting Ignite Cluster and Connect to GridGain Control Center

* Download [Apache Ignite 2.8.1](https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi) or later
* Download GridGain Control Center agent and [put its libs into the Ignite libs folder](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/connect-ignite-cluster).
* [Start a 2-nodes cluster](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start/java#starting-a-gridgain-node)
 using `{root_of_this_project}/template/cfg/ignite-config.xml`. 
* [Connect](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/connect-ignite-cluster) Control Center with your Ignite cluster.

## Example 1: Using SQL for Schema Creation and CRUD operations

### Loading World Database Schema 

Load the data of the World database in the cluster:

* Connect with SQLline: `{ignite}/bin/sqlline.[sh|bat] --verbose=true -u jdbc:ignite:thin://127.0.0.1/`
* Load the database: `!run {root_of_this_project}/template/scripts/ignite_world.sql`

Open [GridGain Control Center SQL screen](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/querying) and 
execute several SQL commands:

* Get the most populated countries:

```
SELECT name, MAX(population) as max_pop FROM country
 GROUP BY name, population ORDER BY max_pop DESC LIMIT 3
```

* Get the most populated cities of the provided countries' list joining records from several tables (the joins are co-located
because `affinityKey` was set in `CREATE TABLE City` command): 

```
SELECT country.name, city.name, MAX(city.population) as max_pop FROM country
     JOIN city ON city.countrycode = country.code
     WHERE country.code IN ('USA','RUS','CHN','KOR','MEX','AUT','BRA','ESP','JPN')
     GROUP BY country.name, city.name 
     ORDER BY max_pop DESC LIMIT 3;
```

This query returns an incorrect result because both `City` and `Country` tables are not co-located. As a temporary workaround,
[enable non-colocated joins](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/querying#non-colocated-joins) for the query to
see that Seoul, Sao Pauolo and Shangai are, in fact, the most inhabited cities.

### Configure Affinity Co-Location and Reload Database Schema

Non-colocated joins are not efficient and can impact performance greatly. We need to co-located `City` and `Country` tables
to support co-located joins for data stored in those tables:

* Add the `AFFINITY_KEY=CountryCode` parameter to the `CREATE TABLE City` command of the 
`{root_of_this_project}/template/scripts/ignite_world.sql` initialization script.
* Reload the database with SQLline: `!run {root_of_this_project}/template/scripts/ignite_world.sql`
* Disable [non-colocated joins flag in Control Center SQL screen](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/querying#non-colocated-joins)
* Execute the same query that joins data properly and will return a correct result (Seoul, Sao Pauolo and Shangai will be reported as
the most populated cities):

```
SELECT country.name, city.name, MAX(city.population) as max_pop FROM country
     JOIN city ON city.countrycode = country.code
     WHERE country.code IN ('USA','RUS','CHN','KOR','MEX','AUT','BRA','ESP','JPN')
     GROUP BY country.name, city.name 
     ORDER BY max_pop DESC LIMIT 3;
``` 

### Update Ignite Records with SQL Commands

* Query a random record like this: `SELECT name, population FROM City WHERE id = 4000;`
* Update the population: `UPDATE City SET population = 5000 WHERE id = 4000;`
* Check that the change took affect: `SELECT name, population FROM City WHERE id = 4000;`

## Example 2: Using Key-Value APIs for CRUD operations

Even though the database was created using DDL syntax, you still can create  POJOs and work with the clustered data using 
key-value, compute and other non-SQL APIs of Ignite.

Open `AppTemplate1KeyValue` source code template that demonstrates several key-value techniques. Search for `DEMO_TODO`
tags in the source code to finish building the application and resolve all possible exceptions the application can generate when
you start it incomplete.

Once you complete all `DEMO_TODOs` making the application fully functional, switch back to the GridGain Control Center SQL
screen and run the following SQL queries to get the updated records but via SQL

* `SELECT name, continent, headofstate FROM Country WHERE code = 'GBR';` - must return Boris Johnson
* `SELECT name, continent, headofstate FROM Country WHERE code = 'USA';` - must return Donald Trump

## Example 3: Updating Records with Distributed ACID Transactions

With Apache Ignite distributed transactions you can modify records of different caches/tables and cluster nodes atomically.

Open `AppTemplate2Transactions` source code template that demonstrates how to use the transactional APIs if you need to 
update a population of two or more Cities atomically. Search for `DEMO_TODO` tags in the source code to finish building 
the application and resolve all possible exceptions the application can generate when you start it incomplete.

## Example 4: Calculating Average Population with Compute APIs

Ignite compute APIs allow us creating custom Java tasks and execute them on server nodes. Depending on the application logic
complexity, this minimizes or fully eliminates data movement over the network and, thus, can improve performance greatly.

Open `AppTemplate3Compute` source code template that calculates an average population across all the cities of a specific country.
The application does this by running a compute task on a server node that keeps all the cities of a country. 
Search for `DEMO_TODO` tags in the source code to finish building the application and resolve all possible exceptions 
the application can generate when you start it incomplete.
